        abstract = {The last decade has seen a shift in emphasis from centralised to decentralised systems to meet the demanding coordination requirements of today's complex computer systems. In such systems, the aim is to achieve effective decentralised control through autonomous software agents that perform local decision-making based on incomplete and imperfect information. Specifically, when the various agents interact, the system behaves as a computational ecology with no single agent coordinating their actions. In this thesis, we focus on one specific type of computational ecology, the Continuous Double Auction (CDA), and investigate market-oriented approaches to decentralised control. In particular, the CDA is a fixed-duration auction mechanism where multiple buyers and sellers compete to buy and sell goods, respectively, in the market, and where transactions can occur at any time whenever an offer to buy and an offer to sell match. Now, in such a market mechanism, the decentralised control is achieved through the decentralised allocation of resources, which, in turn, is an emergent behaviour of buyers and sellers trading in the market. The CDA was chosen, among the plenitude of auction formats available, because it allows efficient resource allocation without the need of a centralised auctioneer. Against this background, we look at both the structure and the behaviour of the CDA in our attempt to build an efficient and robust mechanism for decentralised control. We seek to do this for both stable environments, in which the market demand and supply do not change and dynamic ones in which there are sporadic changes (known as market shocks). While the structure of the CDA defines the agents' interactions in the market, the behaviour of the CDA is determined by what emerges when the buyers and sellers compete to maximise their individual profits. In more detail, on the structural aspect, we first look at how the market protocol of the CDA can be modified to meet desirable properties for the system (such as high market efficiency, fairness of profit distribution among agents and market stability). Second, we use this modified protocol to efficiently solve a complex decentralised task allocation problem with limited-capacity suppliers that have start-up production costs and consumers with inelastic demand. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the structure of this CDA variant is very efficient (an average of 80\% and upto 90\%) by evaluating the mechanism with very simple agent behaviours. In so doing, we emphasise the effect of the structure, rather than the behaviour, on efficiency. In the behavioural aspect, we first developed a multi-layered framework for designing strategies that autonomous agents can use for trading in various types of market mechanisms. We then use this framework to design a novel Adaptive-Aggressiveness (AA) strategy for the CDA. Specifically, our bidding strategy has both a short and a long-term learning mechanism to adapt its behaviour to changing market conditions and it is designed to be robust in both static and dynamic environments. Furthermore, we also developed a novel framework that uses a two-population evolutionary game theoretic approach to analyse the strategic interactions of buyers and sellers in the CDA. Finally, we develop effective methodologies for evaluating strategies for the CDA in both homogeneous and heterogeneous populations, within static and dynamic environments. We then evaluate the AA bidding strategy against the state of the art using these methodologies. By so doing, we show that, within homogeneous populations, the AA strategy outperformed the benchmarks, in terms of market efficiency, by up to 3.6\% in the static case and 2.8\% in the dynamic case. Within heterogeneous populations, based on our evolutionary game theoretic framework, we identify that there is a probability above 85\% that the AA strategy will eventually be adopted by buyers and sellers in the market (for being more efficient) and, therefore, AA is also better than the benchmarks in heterogeneous populations as well.}

The authors find that the order book is moderately informative—its contribution to price discovery is approximately 22\%. The remaining 78\% is from the best bid and offer prices on the book and the last transaction price. Furthermore, the authors find that order imbalances between the demand and supply schedules along the book are significantly related to future short-term returns, even after controlling for the autocorrelations in return, the inside spread, and the trade imbalance. ©2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract="For more than a decade Vytelingum's Adaptive-Aggressive (AA) algorithm has been recognized as the best-performing automated auction-market trading-agent strategy currently known in the AI/Agents literature; in this paper, we demonstrate that it is in fact routinely outperformed by another algorithm when exhaustively tested across a sufficiently wide range of market scenarios. The novel step taken here is to use large-scale compute facilities to brute-force exhaustively evaluate AA in a variety of market environments based on those used for testing it in the original publications. Our results show that even in these simple environments AA is consistently outperformed by IBM's GDX algorithm, first published in 2002. We summarize here results from more than one million market simulation experiments, orders of magnitude more testing than was reported in the original publications that first introduced AA. A 2019 ICAART paper by Cliff claimed that AA's failings were revealed by testing it in more realistic experiments, with conditions closer to those found in real financial markets, but here we demonstrate that even in the simple experiment conditions that were used in the original AA papers, exhaustive testing shows AA to be outperformed by GDX. We close this paper with a discussion of the methodological implications of our work: any results from previous papers where any one trading algorithm is claimed to be superior to others on the basis of only a few thousand trials are probably best treated with some suspicion now. The rise of cloud computing means that the compute-power necessary to subject trading algorithms to millions of trials over a wide range of conditions is readily available at reasonable cost: we should make use of this; exhaustive testing such as is shown here should be the norm in future evaluations and comparisons of new trading algorithms.",

@inproceedings{le,  title  = "Deep Learning can Replicate Adaptive Traders in a Limit-Order-Book Financial Market",  abstract  = "Here we report successful results from using deep learning neural networks (DLNNs) to learn, purely by observation, the behavior of profitable traders in an electronic market closely modelled on the limit-order-book (LOB) market mechanisms that are commonly found in the real-world global financial markets for equities (stocks & shares), currencies, bonds, commodities, and derivatives. Successful real human traders, and advanced automated algorithmic trading systems, learn from experience and adapt over time as market conditions change; our DLNN learns to copy this adaptive trading behavior. A novel aspect of our work is that we do not involve the conventional approach of attempting to predict time-series of prices of tradeable securities. Instead, we collect large volumes of training data by observing only the quotes issued by a successful sales-trader in the market, details of the orders that trader is executing, and the data available on the LOB (as would usually be provided by a centralized exchange) over the period that the trader is active. In this paper we demonstrate that suitably configured DLNNs can learn to replicate the trading behavior of a successful adaptive automated trader, an algorithmic system previously demonstrated to outperform human traders. We also demonstrate that DLNNs can learn to perform better (i.e., more profitably) than the trader that provided the training data. We believe that this is the first ever demonstration that DLNNs can successfully replicate a human-like, or super-human, adaptive trader operating in a realistic emulation of a real-world financial market. Our results can be considered as proof-of-concept that a DLNN could, in principle, observe the actions of a human trader in a real financial market and over time learn to trade equally as well as that human trader, and possibly better.",  keywords  = "Financial Engineering, Financial Markets, Automated Trading, Intelligent Agents, Deep Learning",  author    = "{le Calvez}, Arthur and Dave Cliff",  year      = "2019",  month     = "January",  day       = "28",  doi       = "10.1109/SSCI.2018.8628854",  language  = "English",  isbn      = "9781538692776",  pages     = "1876--1883",  editor    = "Suresh Sundaram",  booktitle = "2018 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (SSCI 2018)",  publisher = "Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)",  address   = "United States", }
