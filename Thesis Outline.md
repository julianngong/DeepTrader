# Thesis Outline
Using deep learning to train an automated adaptive trader to trade on a continuous double auction that uses a limit order book (LOB),  such as the Bristol Stock Exchange (BSE) . This approach to the sales trader problem is not new.  However, traders often have access to a lot more data from a LOB,   which not only indicates the price, but  also volume, quantities and time series information on bids and offers.  The aim is of my thesis is to research whether the utilisation of  these additional parameters given by a LOB can improve the effectiveness of existing automated adaptive traders.
